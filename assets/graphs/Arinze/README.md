# Tree map

This graph shows a tree map chart

The treemap functions as a visualization composed of nested rectangles. These rectangles represent certain categories within a selected dimension and are ordered in a hierarchy, or “tree.” Quantities and patterns can be compared and displayed in a limited chart space. Treemaps represent part to whole relationships.
