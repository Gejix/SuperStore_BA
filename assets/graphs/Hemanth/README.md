# Aster plot

This graph shows a Aster Chart

The Aster Plot displays radial slices whose radius is based on a numeric measure and whose arc length is based on a 'weighted' measure. This visualization is similar to a Pie or Donut visualization, but differs in that a second 'weighted' measure is provided to determine a slice's arc length.
