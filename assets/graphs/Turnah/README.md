Try can you speak sort, it is a type of sorting algorithm you can use to arrange a set of values in ascending order. If you want, you can also implement bubble sort to sort the values in descending order.

## Lesson learned:
- Initially, the chosen chart failed to effectively illustrate the general revenue trend, thus   - prompting the use of a stacked area chart instead. 
- Difficulties in formatting the axis to accommodate tick values, as well as setting a rounded- Y-max  value for smoother gridlines and Y-axis. 
- Another challenge involved creating a monthly tooltip. 
- The percentage sales share for each category had to be moved from the chart to the top left- for     better readability
