# Aster plot

This graph shows an Aster Chart

The Aster Plot displays radial slices whose radius is based on a numeric measure and whose arc length is based on a 'weighted' measure. This visualization is similar to a Pie or Donut visualization, but differs in that a second 'weighted' measure is provided to determine a slice's arc length.

## Purpose: 
    To develop a visualization that demonstrates the profits generated by each product segment.

## Functionality:
-   The visualization employs color-coded legends to represent different segments of the business. 
-   The drop-down menu allows users to filter data by product category. 
-   By clicking on each segment of the Aster plot, users can view the top 10 customers in each segment, sorted by profit share.

## Insights:
-   The Consumer segment was the most profitable for the business, followed by the Corporate segment., while the Home Office segment was the least profitable. 
-   Within the Corporate segment, the Furniture category accounted for 41% of the market share and generated the highest profits. 
-   In contrast, the Consumer segment made the most profit from both the Office Supply and Technology categories, with market shares of 46% and 49%, respectively.

## Lesson learned:
-   The conversion of the initial donut chart to an Aster plot presented some challenges, but they were eventually resolved.
