This graph shows a Tornado Chart

A Tornado diagram is a bar chart that visually displays the magnitude of each risk in a descending order. This gives it the shape of a funnel that looks like a tornado. These are useful project management tools when making decisions and assessing risks at various stages of the project.

## Purpose: 
    To create a visual representation that illustrate the relationship between costs, profits, or losses across different aspects of the business.

## Functionality:
-   The items are differentiated by a colour code based on their respective categories.
-   Interactive category legends enable users to filter products by categories and sub-categories.
-   The first drop-down menu filters the most and least profitable products, while the second drop-down button allows for filtering of data by products, categories, sub-categories, segments, cities, and states.

## Insights: 
-   Despite the higher cost of Phones, the Copiers generated the highest profits for the business.
-   The products such as Phones, Chairs, Storage, Machines and Tables incur higher costs than their respective profits.

## Lesson learned:
-   Overcoming obstacles to eliminate negative signs from the x-axis.
-   The task of truncating product names to fit within the available space presented challenges.
-   Adjusting the left margin to accommodate the displayed data posed significant difficulties.
-   Transforming "loss" bars from negative values to absolute values required a considerable effort.
