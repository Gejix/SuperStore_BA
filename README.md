Business Analytics Interactive Visualization

A Web-base Business Analytics Project Summary

Super Stores approached our team, Blue Ocean, to analyze their data and provide insights for business improvement. Our team consists of five members: a Scrum Master, a Product Owner, a Marketing Manager, a Financial Expert, and a Customer Service Manager.

To start the project, we analyzed Super Stores' sales, customer behavior, and inventory data. We then created an interactive dashboard that presents the data in an easily digestible format, allowing users to explore and manipulate the data for deeper insights. The dashboard served as the foundation for our web-based interactive project, which we built using HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

By using D3.js to recreate the dashboard, we were able to make further improvements to our charts, resulting in a more visually appealing and informative website. Our project provides Super Stores with valuable insights into their business, which can lead to better decision-making and improved profitability.


## Data Set

The provided dataset had vital information to bring impactful changes. The team cleaned, extracted, and formatted the data for each chart's needs to ensure that it was clear and concise, making it easy to interpret and derive meaningful insights that could bring about significant changes to the organization.

## Ethical implication

The data was obtained from Kaggle, an open-source data platform. This indicates that the data has been authorized by the owner for public use.

The large dataset obtained from individuals on Kaggle may have some bias due to the possibility of some individuals opting out of data collection. This could result in equal accuracy, demographic bias, or equal parity bias.
