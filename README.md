Business Analytics Interactive Visualization

A Web-base Business Analytics Project Summary

Super Stores approached our team, Blue Ocean, to analyze their data and provide insights for business improvement. Our team consists of five members: a Scrum Master, a Product Owner, a Marketing Manager, a Financial Expert, and a Customer Service Manager.

To start the project, we analyzed Super Stores' sales, customer behavior, and inventory data. We then created an interactive dashboard that presents the data in an easily digestible format, allowing users to explore and manipulate the data for deeper insights. The dashboard served as the foundation for our web-based interactive project, which we built using HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

By using D3.js to recreate the dashboard, we were able to make further improvements to our charts, resulting in a more visually appealing and informative website. Our project provides Super Stores with valuable insights into their business, which can lead to better decision-making and improved profitability.
